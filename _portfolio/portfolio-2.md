### Research Highlights
- DLVMP inherits the biases of K-Profile Parameterization (KPP, proposed by Large et al (1994)) but improves the simulation of equatorial subsurface temperature climatology due to the inclusion of observational information
- Compared with the Canuto2001 (proposed by Canuto et al (2001)) scheme, both DLVMP and KPP underestimate surface mixing and overestimate subsurface mixing in the equatorial Pacific
- These simulation biases lead to significant differences in temperature, salinity, mixed-layer depth, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and subtropical cell (STC) among the experiments
- The underestimated surface mixing weakens mid-latitude ventilation, causing an upward shift and intensification of the STC and producing a pronounced cold bias near the thermocline in the DLVMP experiment
