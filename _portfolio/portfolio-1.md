### Research Highlights
- Identified that the asymmetric temperature response to zonal wind‚Äêstress forcing in the western Pacific is commonly underestimated by ocean models
- A generally weaker zonal currents in ocean models than in the observations is a cause of the underestimated asymmetric temperature response
- The weaker zonal current response in ocean models is linked to a less steep zonal tilt of the thermocline
