Welcome to my homepage!


At the beginning
======
I don't get used to show myself to other people. Like running, what I have to do is to keep breathing silent, matain comfortable pace and endure the continoues pressure from mental, finally letting me go much longer and farer than I used to go. The picture below depicts the moment when I challenged myself with half-marathon race. And I'm preparing for another half-marathon race. But here I am! To arrange my current situation and fight for the future long-lasting marathon-like career.

Jin Li is now persuing his Doctor degree of meterology in Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
